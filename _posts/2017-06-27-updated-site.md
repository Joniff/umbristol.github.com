We've been looking at possible options in terms of providing a better online experience and have decided that Jekyll + GitHub Pages is the way forward for this site.

There are a few reasons for this:

- we already had a simple static site
- we were starting to use some of the features that Jekyll + GitHub Pages provides
- it's straightforward to make changes
- posts can be added in markdown
- changes are open to everyone
- it's easy to push updates
- it's free!

And that's about it really, we'll be looking to make some enhancements along the way as we start to figure out how we can improve.

### Contributions

As mentioned above, we would gladly accept any PRs for any updates that you feel the site needs. Here's a few ideas:

- spruce up the site with some extra styles
- integrate meetup so we can pull in the events dynamically
- make a kick ass [404](/404/) page
- add [jekyll-emoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji) support
- add some other [jekyll plugin](https://github.com/jekyll) that takes your fancy
- revert all the colours to Umbraco <span class="orange">orange</span>
