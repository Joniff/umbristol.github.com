The Bristol Umbraco User Group - [umbristol.co.uk](http://umbristol.co.uk)

The aim of the user-group is to meet on a monthly basis, with a 2-monthly rotation: one month being an informal social gathering at a pub; the following month an office-based session/talk meet-up hosted by a local Umbraco partner/business.

The user-group was established in January 2010. A typical social meet-up is attended by 10+ people, where as the session/talks meet-ups attract larger attendees (20+ people).

## Sponsors

We welcome potential sponsors to get in touch with us, but please note we do not accept recruitment companies or similar. We just feel that it is not appropriate for the events and the type of people that we are looking to attract for these meetups.
